the code.

The suggested directory structure for projects has been created
for you:

* analysis: contains files which involve loading and working with data
* lib: contains packages and libraries which support analysis
  * python: Python-specific packages
  * r: R-specific packages
* manuscripts: writeups of the project results (e.g. latex files)
* presentations: .ppt files or create a README.md with links
